                <br /> One of the primary functions of PEX+ is to help our users more easily and quickly find their preferred award flight*. Let's walk through the process of doing a flight search.
                <br /> *Note: If you're new to loyalty programs and frequent flyer miles, see our guide <a href="http://pexportal.com/blog/Apr-2016/the-beginners-holy-grail-of-frequent-flyer-miles">The Beginner's Holy Grail of Frequent Flyer Miles</a>.
                <ol style="font-size: 14px">
                    <li>
                        On either the <a href="pexportal.com">homepage</a> or the <a href="pexportal.com/flights">flights page</a>, make sure you see the search form.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <img src="{% static 'flightsearch/img/searchform.png' %}" width="100%">
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>Select the type of flight you're searching for. You can choose between one-way, round-trip, and multi-city. Each option will change the form fields accourdingly.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>Enter your search into the appropriate fields. Note that as you're entering your city or airport code into each of the appropriate form field(s), a dropdown with options will display under each corresponding form field. You must select the appropriate airport or city option from the dropdown.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <img src="{% static 'flightsearch/img/gettingstarteddropdown.png' %}" width="100%">
                        <br />
                        <br /> There's a calendar dropdown for selecting each, departing and returning dates.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <img src="{% static 'flightsearch/img/gettingstartedcalendardropdown.png' %}" width="100%">
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>The default selected fare class is economy (aka. coach) and the default number of passengers selected is one adult. If you need to change the fare class and/or the number of travelers, select the form field to display the dropdown of options.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <center><img src="{% static 'flightsearch/img/gettingstartedfareclasspassengerdropdown.png' %}" width="50%"></center>
                        <br />
                        <br /> Then select your fare class and add the appropriate number of passengers. Once you've finished this, click or press the apply button to apply these changes to your search.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>Select whether you want to perform an exact date search or a flexible date search and then click the search button.</li>
                    <br />
                </ol>
                <br /> Upon initiating your search, you'll be taken to the search results page. You will see a search loading popup to let you know your search results are loading; this will disappear in approximately fifteen seconds. While you wait, you're welcome to sign-up for an email notification from us for when the price decreases for your flight as well as sign up for our newsletter.
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src="{% static 'flightsearch/img/gettingstartedsearchloading.png' %}" width="100%">
                <br />
                <br /> Once the search loading pop-up disappears after the fifteen seconds, you'll be able to browse through your search results and use the filters to narrow down your flight options. All search result options are live and if you see the option it's available with the corresponding airline.
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src="{% static 'flightsearch/img/gettingstartedflightresults.png' %}" width="100%">
                <br />
                <br /> If you want a quick overview of the lowest available award prices for each fare class for your flight search, lick on the price matrix link.
                <br />
                <br />
                <center><img src="{% static 'flightsearch/img/gettingstartedflightmatrix.png' %}" width="50%"></center>
                <br />
                <br /> If you performed a flexible date search ("flex search") you can click on the award availability calendar to view award availability for your search from all of the airlines we currently offer.
                <br />
                <br />
                <center><img src="{% static 'flightsearch/img/gettingstartedavailibilitycal.png' %}" width="50%"></center>
                <br />
                <br /> To know which airline's mileage currency to use for a flight option, let the airline logos be your guide. In the below example, we have a flight from New York to Beijing. The flight is operated by Air China. However, the logo displayed is United Airlines. Therefore, this search result is a United codeshare flight with Air China and the price displayed is in United MileagePlus frequent flyer miles. The dollar price displayed is the total taxes, surcharges, and fees for purchasing this flight - all dollar prices are in, or converted to, U.S. dollars.
